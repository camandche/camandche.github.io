<h2>My Reflections - Sprint One</h2> 

<h4>In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:</h4>

<h2>Command Line Primer</h2>

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

<h3>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h3>
<p>The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text program terminal that interprets lines of code & follows the instructions contained within to create, manipulate, store & delete content within a computing system. It is also faster than using the Graphic User Interface (GUI).

It's like having to instruct a robot to walk around. You have to think about writing the code for it in a specific order, like to open it's eyes, stand up from it's resting spot, then move it's left arm forward at the same time that the right leg moves forward & then repeat that process but swap it around where the right arm moves forward when the left leg moves forward & have that repeating on a loop until you want to give it another command. If you enter in the wrong set of instructions at the wrong time, your output will not be what you desired, but, it does interpret things exactly as you programmed it!
</p>

<h3>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h3>
<p>Urgh, far from it! Needed to familiarise self with the correct software & finding my bearings with everything - especially navigating around Github. The nested content slowed me down a lot as I kept getting lost & couldn't find my way back to where I needed to be. Just need to familarise self with my new environment more & time management will eventually fall into place. Naviation was getting better the more times I utilised everything. It helped leaving breadcrumbs everywhere (shortcuts on desktop & bookmarks in places). Plus, kept forgetting to start/stop the timer, so the figures are totally inaccurate, but practice will make perfect. Need to get into a routine & all will be good. Glad I have 3x monitors back up & running, that will definitely help speed things up!
</p>

<h3>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do</h3>
<ol>
  <li>cd = change directory</li>
  <li>pwd = print working directory</li>
  <li>git add command as in 'git add -A' = (-A flag = add all content). 3 part process, 1 = STAGING - gets content ready; takes files you made changes to locally in the Working Directory & stores them in the Staging Index, like a waiting room</li>
  <li>git commit command as in 'git commit -m ""' = (-m flag = message). 3 part process, 2 = COMMITTING - takes the files waiting in the Staging Index & saves them in the Repository</li>
  <li>git push command as in 'git push'. 3 part process, 3rd = PUSHING - we've Staged & Committed the files & now need to push the Repository back upstream to the Master in GitHub</li>
</ol>

<h2>Install and Explore Git</h2> 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

<h3>Whats the difference between git and GitHub?</h3>
<p>Git is a version control tool that's stored locally on your machine. It allows the user to clone or fork a repository from GitHub (a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)) - which is the remote repository stored up in the cloud). Git allows a user to manipulate the content within their own repository without making changes to the remote repository until the push/pull commands are used. GitHub allows multiple users to access & clone their own branches or forks of a repository & work on the same code at the same time as others while GitHub will use version control to track different changes & document all amended versions. It removes the need to store multiple versions of the same code in various places which could lead to lost data & time.</p>

<h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</h3>
<p>Having an alternate timeline different to the original path is like two best mates that eventually go their own separate ways in life. They may cross paths again one day (clone), or maybe never againa (fork).</p>

<h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
<p>Didn't think it would have mattered much, but orientation, the week prior, is a necessary pre-requisite! I thought I knew what to expect, but I forgot just how important it is to see who we will be connecting with, what to do, where to locate things & how to navigate from A to B. Think I would've been in a better headspace if I had more time to prepare instead of wasting time trying to locate things, only to lose them often just because I was unfamiliar with my surroundings. It's really made my brain work for sure as I do struggle with nested content, while it's nice to have access to a multitude of information in the one space, it congests my mind too much & I easy get lost, but familiarisation will help me get over this hurdle!
<p>Completed study previously, but coming back to programming has really scared me to death! Even though I have been enjoying learning new things this week & it's reignited this passion & the fact I'm actually following things correctly, but I am worried about timing & getting tasks completed on time, especially when I hit brick walls - which was a real doozer one this week.

<p>I realised near the end of the Branch-Pull-Merge challenge, that I had a couple of critical errors where I had downloaded config files during the prep phase, but forgot to install the contents, rookie move I know! I knew that I needed access to these files & also knew that I'd have an issue if I reinstalled them. Couldn't move forward with what I needed to do, tried committing things so that I had access to a copy of files just-in-case, but it wouldn't work. Urgh, why? Eventually found out that it was because I had somehow branched into another directory & lost the master link. I just couldn't figure out why things were giving me grief all of a sudden. Such a pain! I couldn't see what needed to be reconfigured or what content had been manipulated & really couldn't remember what changes had happened because at this stage, I was just a robot plodding along! It was a nightmare of a mess. I was at the point of having a programmers block (like a writers block) moment. Brain just shut down & I thought that was it. I couldn't see anything & nothing made sense at all! When I'm in this state of mind, I know I'm shot. People can talk to me until they're blue in the face, but I will not be able to hear them. My time coding was done!</p>
I'm mindful that I've always been slower off the starting block than others, as I utilise that time to really cement a process because I always ask the question, 'But why?' Why are we doing something this way when it looks like it can be done faster if we headed in another direction instead. But in saying that, 'Why reinvent the wheel if there was nothing wrong with the process that's been working solidly for the past 20 years?' Change is good, but only if it's for the better & for the right reasons. Things need to make sense to me. No point in just reguritating data without understanding why things need to done a certain way. Once I've reached logical sense & the knowledge is downpacked in my mind, watch out!</p>
<p>But, I have a kinesthetic learning style, I utilise all my senses & thrive better in a classroom environment ... to a point. I absorb visually where you'll see me jotting down content just to 'SEE' what is being spoken about; otherwise it's gone 5 seconds later. The speaker's mannerism or the way the information is presented either captures me or turns me off. That can be annoying if I know it contains great information; but because my attention span becomes limited, it takes a lot of energy to push through that barrier & try to focus. Same applies with watching YouTube videos, you either capture my attention or I move on! But I really enjoyed the Udacity courses. Pace was great, presenter explained things in layman terms, listed the coding we needed, defined what it would do & what would be returned from executing this code. I managed to keep up nicely, without too many hiccups, until this huge issue I was now facing.</p>
<p>It's at this stage when I need to remove myself from every distraction possible & just be in my own little bubble - my 'cone-of-silence'. There's no point of reaching out to people. Yes, I would've had the answer sooner, but I would not have learnt anything from this lesson, otherwise, how am I to fix things the next time this happens?</p>
<p>I took mini breaks walking away & coming back, but the code was still foreign to me. Google & my partner (whose based in Christchurch - I'm in Hawke's Bay) only agitated me as I just couldn't see the answers & I just needed silence to think. Kept plodding along with things & then Eureka; all of a sudden made sense! Like I'd mentioned, I had branched into another area while trying to commit things in another direction. Recloned & started over again ... correctly. It was 2 in the morning & I finally had clarity! Yes! My commands were working & I could see the end was near!</p>
<p>Totally stoked! I had perservered with things & by the end of it all, I knew what the cause was, I remembered how to get from A to B & managed to submit what I needed to in time! Yes!</p>
<p>Amongst all this, I wondered if I was dyslexic at times as I'll be zooming along typing commands out & then wondering why they're not working. Sometimes my letters are jumbled up, because the brains working faster than the hands will go, or I have a space in my code where there shouldn't be one, (or the infamous ; issue - grrr, prepping for when that'll come knocking) or the common one at the mo ... I'm doing the wrong stuff in the wrong directory! Gees! Need to practice more!!! But I can trump that one, I somehow accessed Git Bash & like the layout more than Git CMD & wondered why my Windows related functions weren't working with it! I still use it though ... it's prettier, LOL I mean I can see the code better by visually removing the noise of just black & white text (although the colour has been automated) & crops up every now & then on Git CMD, but I'm having the same success using Git Bash, so I'll just keep plodding along utilising both for now.</p>

<h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
<p>Would prefer to have had access to the required software so that we could navigate around the program to familiarise ourselves before starting the course. Same with getting access to the Student Handbook, loads of reading! I would also like to have attended the orientation meeting as this would have helped me settle in more (advised that same afternoon that a space was made available for this cohort & unfortunately was going to be out of town that weekend & had no time to prep).</p>


<h2>Branch, Pull, Merge</h2>

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

<h3>What is Master?</h3>
<p>This is the default branch where the best-tested code is kept & (in this instance), is stored upstream online in GitHub. This repository can be cloned or forked to Git for the local user to manipulate the content & will need to go through a 3-step process using the push/pull commands to send it back upstream</p>


<h3>Why create a Branch?</h3>
<p>A branch repository is a copy taken from the master branch to be used to manipulate content within the repository without overriding the content held in the Master branch</p>

<h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</h3>
<p>The Staging Index is like a waiting room (just like being engaged). You're putting your content (files/directories etc) in this room waiting for you to send the package to the repository. Once you are ready to send the files here, this is where we commit to the process (or in this instance, marry your loved one)</p>


<h2>GitHub Fork & Clone</h2>

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

<h3>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>
<p>Fork is where you're taking a copy of a project from the Master repository & create a new upstream repository (which remains in the cloud in GitHub). Examples of this may be to start a new project that may not be related to the original Master repository or that you do not have write permission to work on the main repository directly.</p>


<h3>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h3>
<p>Yes the difference between fork & clone was easy to decipher. Drawing a picture helps but not necessary in this instance as long as I understood that FORK = upstream repository stored globally in GitHub & CLONE = repository copy which is stored locally in Git

The biggest moment was when I didn't think I'd fix my coding issue, as it had too many critical issues. I couldn't see where the problem started & how corrupt my files ended up getting, I just knew I'd stuffed it up bigtime! Was trying to fix things & the lightbulb switched on & I thought, surely that couldn't be the answer, but it was! ... I was saving everything in the wrong directory & created a new branch in the root directory instead!!! Made a mess of everything after I was doing so well! I started from scratch again & moving things around & all of sudden, it worked! No dramas! YES!</p>


<h2>Setup Repo & Create Blog</h2>

<h3>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h3>
<p>Process is getting easier once you start repeating the steps a few more times. It helps cement the teaching in your brain. Thought I was a know-it-all at this stage, tried cloning locally & forgot to check I had the correct directory to the one I wanted the file to sit in, ah nope! Too late, stuffed up! Whoops!</p>


<h3>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</h3>
<p>Not really, it seemed easier than I remember really.</p>


<h3>Thinking like a programmer</h3>
<p>I'm quite an analytical person & constantly live in my mind thinking of ways to work smarter & not harder. How are things created? What was the purpose of why they were made? What was the issue people were trying to solve? Was it a success?

Flipped learning is how I've successfully managed to absorb things in life; by being actively involved in this different style of teaching & it works for me. I just love getting my hands dirty & utilising the extra braincell to figure out what to do next. It is a complete contrast to just cramming words & formulas in your head only to try & extract it in time for exams hopefully ... if your mind doesn't have birds chirping!

Had flipped learning been available in classes back in my day, I'm sure I would have thrived faster.</p>

<h3>What is your process so far for solving problems?</h3>
<p>For as long as I remember I've been great at problem-solving. I thrive in simplifying environments & spot bottlenecks all the time. I'm a sponge that loves absorbing life around me. I like seeing how people interact & communicate with others & I am always interested in the 'How's' & the 'Why's'. How did they create heavy objects that transport people in the sky? Why did they move the Stonehenge Stones from one place to another? What is this niftly blade that manually cuts through wheat?

The last two issues here, I resolved. Couldn't figure out why people were using their brain to manually calculate process times when scientific calculators could do it for them? They had smart people around, but no one took the time to see ways to make people's lives better. (I introduced these around the Sterilisation Dept in the Food Manufacturing Industry - it saved a lost of grief, increased productivity & decreased downtime & saved the company a lot of money in the long run). They used them for years & were only swapped out as the company were moving to automated systems. Then in the Forward-freighting industry, I staggered start times for drivers who were starting at the same time because we only had one loading ramp meaning only one shipping container could be filled at a time. Drivers were happy because they weren't twiddling their thumbs for ages & neither we were waiting for 2 hrs for all of them to return back at the same time! Bit of common sense really, no?

With my Quality/Auditing background, I have beady eyes that spot things extremely well!</p>


<h2>Introduce yourself</h2>

<h3>What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</h3>
<p>Easier than standing in front of people! I'm usually a social butterfly anyway as I know what it feels like to be uncomfortable in crowds or people staring at you, so I make the effort & go introduce myself first.</p>

<h3>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</h3>
<p>Yes I suppose reflecting on this has boosted the ego somewhat. I'm definitely self conscious all the time & are mindful of my surroundings & people close by, but it's probably way easier sitting in front of monitors & just being a keyboard warrior!</p>
