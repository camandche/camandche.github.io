      <p>Hi y’all, Cheryl Wichman here. Late comer these ways - only found out there was a place on the Manaia cohort last Thursday & been putting the ducks in a row ever since; eek no pressure!</p>
<br>

<p>Kiwi born & bred in Hawke’s Bay & probably old enough to be everyone’s Mama! I love working smarter - not harder & have worn a few hats in my lifetime just to ‘feed my mind’. I’m drawn towards talented people who I can both learn from & also contribute my own personal experiences with. They must be able to make me screw up my face, shake my head & crack up at their jokes … because I don’t know any, but I do love a good laugh!
Same applies with businesses. I love ones that are respected in the community, having the integrity to look after both their clients & their staff & I like to be in roles where I can grow from as well as contribute my skillset towards.
Got a promotion into this logistical / co-ordinator role & thought YES, finally getting paid for my smarts … ‘til I became a statistic from this pandemic a month later & got the ‘Don’t Come Monday’ notice! Gees!
In a way, it was a blessing in disguise. I’ve always worked hard for what I wanted & made sacrifices just to get that shiny new toy, but staring at this crossroad made me realise just what a J-O-B really meant, as Robert Kiyosaki says, “It’s Just Over Broke!”
Took a step back & reassessed life’s journey. Why are we here? What am I passionate about? How can our family survive if I’m takin some time out to focus on myself? I have a lot of different interests & I’d love to do them all, but, had enough of being a good wifey, look after the kids, put a roof over their heads & food in their bellies; you know, doing the things a responsible adult does?
My eldest will be 21 soon & doing well for himself. You can’t smother them with bubble-wrap … how will they ever learn how to survive in life? I’ve been wanting to cut that umbilical cord for years & I’m finally taking the time out to complete this course for myself as it’s been on the back burner for the past 5 years; way too long!
Like others here, I’m wanting to utilise the new skillset to make a positive change in our lives, one that can be done from anywhere around the world, at any time of the day or night!
