          <h2><strong><i>Describe your core personal values</i></strong></h2>
            <p>
              I have a few core values that people will discover about me. I’m:
                <ul>
                  <li>Honest</li>
                  <li>Loyal</li>
                  <li>Integrity</li>
                  <li>Commitment</li>
                  <li>Reliable</li>
                  <li>Efficient</li>
                  <li>Innovative</li>
                  <li>Compassionate</li>
                  <li>Optimistic</li>
                  <li>Passionate</li>
                  <li>Adventurous</li>
                  <li>Positive</li>
                  <li>Respectful</li>
                  <li>Talented</li>
                  <li>Humourous</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              If I had to pick, just 3, it will be: <strong>Talented, Loyal & Compassionate.</strong>
            
              My strong morals can come across as being snobby at times, but I choose to stand my ground & not follow others in a direction if I believe it is not getting me closer to my goals in life. You can walk a path together, but it is ok to also be brave & try doing something new too. Other people’s fears should not stop you from following your passion & that is what’s awesome about us being unique individuals. We all have different tastes & want to do things different to our friends or loved ones.
              And it’s ok to fail as that is where the learning part comes in. If you fail doing the same thing over & over again, but cannot see it … that’s NOT ok as you are not learning your lesson & will not be able to move forward from the experience until you do!
            </p>

            <h3>Talented</h3>
              <p>
                I picked this one as I thrive when learning new things, but I don’t brag about the skills I hold. If you’re one of the lucky ones that gets to experience that talent - then count us both lucky!
              </p>

            <h3>Loyal</h3>
            <p>
              In saying that, I am fiercely committed & loyal to any relationship & promises made in either work or personal circumstances.

              If I give my word to someone, I try to keep it.
              
              Same with jobs & deadlines, I'll commit myself 100% to get a project across the finish line within the allocated time range, If I believe I will miss that deadline, I will advise those concerned as soon as I know. An example of this was when I found out that I was losing my job due to this pandemic. We were in level 4 lockdown & working from home for a month before I was no longer needed. I had all these emotions running through my mind, but I wanted to do my best at dotting my I’s & crossing those t’s as I did not want them to blame me for anything & I wanted to leave on good terms.
            </p>

            <h3>Compassionate</h3>
            <p>
                I am extremely compassionate, but have been burnt over the years from sob stories where people have said one thing & done something else, so I’m more cautious about assessing situations because I believe the majority of people are good people; some just choose to make unsavoury choices in their lives & are either here in yours for a reason or just a season. You can either be a positive influence in their lives & help them up or without realising it, hold them back. Choice is yours & it doesn’t need to be financial assistance either. That won’t help them out in the long term. Teaching them how to be better with money may help instead.
            </p>  
            <p>
              But all they could need is a:
            
            <ul>
            <li>Kind ear to listen to their stories</li>
            <li>Shoulder to cry on or just a hug</li>
            <li>Couple of Words of Wisdom</li>
            <li>Donation - something like clothes / blankets etc</li>
            </ul>
            
            But the medicine I like providing (besides my time) is laughter - it goes a long way & they’re both free!</p>
            
            <h3>Ethical Decision Made</h3>
              <p>
                Was in a position where a work associate was absent-minded & kept doing dangerous things but dismissed that they were an issue as she kept citing, she was only ‘getting picked on as she was a female truck driver.’
                We were loading product into the back of her shipping container & I was on the edge of the ramp half inside the container when I heard the truck start up, but then she started pulling away. Seriously not cool when the ground was probably about 1.5m below you! That was a serious Health & Safety issue that could have ended much differently. Yelled out & jumped back to the ramp but when approached, the driver shrugged off the fact that I was going to report it, like it wasn’t a big deal.
                There was no hesitation, I raised it with my manager & filled out a ‘Near Miss Incident Report’ as it was not the first time a situation involving this person came to light, but it was my first time an incident occurred with me & it needed to be addressed before someone died. 
                Seems morbid, but the other incidents were near misses of a similar nature & no one flagged it. Her actions were making our work environment unsafe! I would not have been able to live with myself if I did nothing & someone got injured, just because I was too scared because she was the boss’ wife! The thought didn’t cross my mind as someone needed to take action & address this issue pronto.
                A disciplinary meeting was made after the review & keys were taken off all truck drivers while their trucks were being loaded with product - removing a repeat performance!
                She stopped talking to me thinking I picked on her & I was asked if I could continue working with her & said ‘It was fine’ - as long as everyone around us felt safe again, that was all that mattered.
              </p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Influence</h3>
              <p>
                My culture doesn’t influence my life really. I don’t like labels or treat people any differently based on the colour of their skin, their past actions or their beliefs in life. As long as you’re a decent person, that’s trying to better yourself, that’s all that matters. Everybody makes mistakes; we have to learn from it, pick ourselves up & move forward. I suppose that’s a huge strength of mine that I’m usually the one who’s calm in a crisis as I’m organising what needs to be done without involving my emotions until after the fact. My limitations would be that I don’t embrace my culture much. As I am a mixed breed, I didn’t really feel like I belonged in any bubble, neither Cook Island Maori or Maori, I preferred my own personal culture, one where I stole traits from others, as I didn’t like having boundaries restricting my own belief & growth.
              </p>
              
            <h3>Learning & Career Development Strengths & Limitations</h3>
              <p>
                My strength is that I managed to figure out what helps me learn & that is by utilising all my senses. I learnt I could not focus if I just sat in a classroom & listened … because I couldn’t just sit there & listen! My mind would be wandering everywhere else instead! I found scribing helped direct my attention better.
                I thrive in any educational environment as long as I find the subjects interesting & put my mind to it.

                When I was in High School, I always thought I was only there to eat my lunch as I couldn’t understand why we had to learn about dead people (William Shakespeare). This was a limitation of mine! If I had no interest in the topic & didn’t know how that information would help me in my future, why did I have to try & absorb the content?  In saying that though, I took a picture of the house where he grew up in thinking ‘If only my English teacher could see me now!’ I was really buzzing standing outside Shakespeare’s home in Stratford-Upon-Avon. It was surreal that a person as great as him had walked the streets where I was standing many years later. Although I didn’t like being forced to read his books that I had no interest in, I did like physically being present in a place where greatness happened.
                This is similar to developing my career. I rarely went after jobs with titles as I was felt drawn towards what the jobs entailed instead. I suppose this could be classed as both a strength & a weakness as I would be a minion working under someone but running departments like I WAS the boss! I felt that by getting involved in the thick of things, helped me to understand all the different roles around me, how the relationships between co-workers & departments operated, what worked vs what didn’t. It made me see areas to improve, gave me the confidence to come out of my shell & learn to communicate with others - which became a strength of mine as people knew I could be relied upon to help them out when needed & I hoped they would do the same for me in return. By developing my career like this, it identified things I found interesting & identified things that I didn’t. Because of that, I have many interests & various fingers in different pies, but the experience moulded me into the person I am today.

            <h3>Strength to help with Learning Journey</h3>
              <p>
                Multi-tasking is a great skill I use as I can juggle quite a few things around at a time which may help with the pace this program runs at. It may intersect & become an obstacle if my attention was spread too thinly though & I would risk wasting time going back over things if I forgot where I was.
              </p>
              
            <h3>Team Work Resistance</h3>
              <p>
                I had a colleague who would bark orders thinking she had explained a process when she hadn’t mentioned anything to me. It was like I needed to sit in her mind & jump on things well in advance, but the young team I worked with didn’t like sharing any information & I always felt like an outsider walking on eggshells around them all the time. I had no idea what needed to be done as no one was willing to slow down & train me. Kept my ears open to see if that helped, but it didn’t really & I started to hate going to work because of the negative atmosphere there. But I learnt from my mistakes & was prepared for next time. Eventually I managed to keep up with everyone & outranked in places, but the experience cut right down to my soul & I hated the fact I stuck it out for as long as I did. It turned me into an introvert who lost her voice. I vowed no one else was going to have a lack of training as the more information I could share with someone, the more work they could help with meaning, less stress for all & the workload was spread evenly across the team. This helped when people were absent from work as we job-shared & eventually knew others’ roles, so we could fill in where necessary. In hind-sight I should have spoken up more, but didn’t want my head bitten off any more than it was, but the whole experience left an imprint on me I try & shake off when I think about it now.
