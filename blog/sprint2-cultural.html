        <h3>Long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            I’m wanting to be in a better financial position by tapping into this skillset & being able to utilise it fully anywhere around the world. I see beautiful things being created with programming & it would be nice to be able to tap into this industry & make necessary changes to things myself.
          </p>

        <h3>Non-technical - human skills Developed?</h3>
          <p>
            Something to open people up in front of others. I notice I tend to freak out & go into my shell with smart people around & I never seem to show all of my talents, which is weird to me as I don’t like all the attention, when really I do??? I am a social-butterfly (& will entertain the crowd if there’s a mic around), but I do limit the amount of time in the limelight (as I need to withdraw & have time to heal); apparently it’s called an ambivert (mix of introvert & an extrovert tendencies).
          </p>

        <h3>Strengths & Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            I am a 'Gill-of-all-trades', I thrive from strength to strength whether it be in money matters, administrative work, building presentations, looking through open homes, travel excursions, getting ideas for cooking, growing own food, building (just love construction or upcycling) & learning new things right down to being an electrician’s helper etc. A strength in me is that I will persevere with a task at hand, however this could become a limitation as I know what I want & will make sacrifices & go without until I reach my goal faster. But with coding, it visually just doesn’t compute sometimes & my instructions seem to be jargon when I’m staring at the command line! Sometimes that brick wall keeps getting in my way & it’s hard to break away from it & ask for help as I’ve been surrounded by coders before & it seems so easy for them that they’ll just come & fix things but go too fast for me to absorb the content. I do notice at times like that, where I need time to mull over it for a bit longer, I will have a break & come back to things with fresh eyes. That & it seems I need complete silence (no distractions from loved ones – or even music, mobile phone, social media, emails, nada etc … ). It’s like my serious multi-tasking skills don’t work in the realm of programming!
          </p>

        <h3>Workload Committment</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve committed to this programme so much that people find it weird when I say I need to go & focus on my studies as they’re in a different head-space to me but it’s only for 15 weeks & I really REALLY want to get this ticked off this time around!
          </p>

        <h3>Assistance</h3>
          <p>
            Think I’ve been playing catch-up since the beginning, but everyone looks like they’ve steam-rolled ahead of me & by the time I’ve caught up with the week’s sprint, it’s usually around 3am when I’m scratching my head looking for answers. I’ve just got to dedicate more time to catching up & then ask the questions sooner rather than later as it annoys me that I’m taking longer than expected for this to sink in! It makes sense right up until it doesn’t! But so far, I believe I just need a couple more days … maybe a 9-day week & I should be fine to continue onto the next sprint!
          </p>
          <p>
            I find the Slack community’s a great place for answers as someone’s usually asked the question that I need so that helps. Also, it’s nice to know the facilitation team is at the other end of the line too!
          </p>

        <h3>Facilitation Expectation</h3>
          <p>
            I like the way there’s a weekly catch-up, it keeps me honest on my progress & my facilitator’s great & spots things that need resolving.
          </p>

        <h3>Scheduled Committments</h3>
          <p>
            The past couple of weeks we have had huge Whanau gathering’s that I could not postpone or cancel on & had to juggle my workload to suit by committing longer nights just to make it across the line. (Another 2x events will be occurring again around the end of August, early September so I need to be mindful about these as well).
          </p>
          <p>
          It showed this week as I was not happy with my websites end-result in comparison to liking everyone else’s websites, but it was what it was. I do worry that the commitment level will only get fuller as the weeks go by, but life happens & I’ve found that I work better in the early hours of the morning & hopefully as time ticks on I will have more experience & be able to keep up with things more.
