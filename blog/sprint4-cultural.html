      <h2> Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h3>Benefitting People</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is also known as brain plasticity or brain malleability, stemmed from morphing two words together -
              <ul>
                <li.list-group-item><strong>Neural:</strong> relates to the nervous system while</li.list-group-item><br>
                <li.list-group-item><strong>Plasticity:</strong> relates to the capacity to adapt or change</li.list-group-item>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is where the neural network of one's brain fires up nerons in a way that stimulates a connection between cells. The more times the connection is utilised, the stronger the path connects & the more active one's mind becomes. However, there is also the mindset that, "If you don't use it, you'll lose it" as science proves that this could just be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity is where the brain reorganises itself, especially with areas that have been damaged over the years. It will strength the connections that are used more often in the brain & readjust the connections that are not used as often or are damaged areas.
            </p>

          <h4>Improving our Neuroplasticity - Dr Kelly Lambert, Neuro Scientist</h4>
            <p>
              In the video below, Dr Lambert addreses ways to improve our neuroplasticity by engaging in smart behavioural patterns from scientific testing on a group of rats. It triggered how we handle & process change, identifying similar developmental patterns (in humans), where the rats had to make an effort to be rewarded vs another group of rats who were just given things. She puts the rats to work where they'd harvest fruit loops hidden in mounds of bedding. The group that had to work for their efforts, had brain activity connections between the 'rewards area' & the 'motor movement' areas of their brain. It was also noted that the rats living in a 'country-based environment', seemed better off than the controlled groups of rats that were in a 'standard environment' setting where they were just given the fruit loops with no effort of thinking involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interestingly enough, the engaged rats living in more of a natural environment were stimulised more than their counterparts as they were always doing something. They worked more as a team, which increased their oxytocin levels & had higher emotional resilience, while having lower stress hormonal levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              The human brain has similar functionalities as Dr Lambert's research shows we can change our neuro chemistry just by engaging in smart behaviours like these groups of rats identified.
            </p>
            <p>
              Historical research revealed that prescribing knitting to women with anxiety issues, calmed the nerves as they became more focused on their knitting. It revealed the following areas are triggered to help lower anxiety levels - an increase in serotonin, dopamine & oxytocin levels, while decreasing stress hormonal levels

       <h3>Ways to increase your Neuroplasticity Levels</h3>
          <h4>
            Increase in Serotonin Levels
          </h4>
            <p>
              Serotonin is a neuro transmitter in the body, which is increased when engaged in repetitive behaviour, like completing our kata sprints this week. This shows that if we are exposed to situations where we have to work for things in life, the repetitive work enhances the brain functionality along with working together in groups to solve problems. 
            </p>
          <h4>
            Increase in Dopamine Levels
          </h4>
            <p>
              This too is also a pleasurable neuro transmitter that is increased, when someone is focused in anticipation, like looking forward to finishing each weeks sprint!
            </p>
          <h4>
            Decrease in Stress Hormones Levels
          </h4>
            <p>
              Slowing down could be a hard ask in these modern times, but studies show cortisol is the primary stress hormone which increases the glucose in the bloodstream. So try decreasing your stress hormone levels by focusing on something calming (like knitting or another activity - like yoga). This can help remove the triggers & help lower the stress levels. 
            </p>
          <h4>
            Increase Oxytocin Levels
          </h4>
            <p>
              Secreted from the pituitary gland, this hormone is also called the 'cuddle chemical' that is released when people bond socially or snuggle up closely. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Seems that any physical activity that is repetitive, stimulates that extra brainmatter & brings you joy & happiness, just do it!
            </p>

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
          <p>
            Have you ever come across someone who is fixed on something & you could speak your viewpoint ('til you're blue in the face) & they just WON'T BUDGE; their mind's made up! You would class this person as a 'Fixed Mindset'. Then there could be another friend & you're both on the same wavelength, they're open to your thoughts & suggestions & are interested in expanding their mind more?! Chances are, is that this second person, like yourself, would have a 'Growth Mindset'. Check out the attached image supplied by <a href="https://www.screwtheninetofive.com/differences-between-growth-and-fixed-mindset/"> Screw the nine to five blog by Suzie Flynn</a> which gives a better definition between the two mindsets.
