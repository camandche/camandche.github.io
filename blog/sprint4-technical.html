          <h2> Problem Solving</h2>

            <h3>Getting Blocked on a Simple Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Had a real doozer with this weeks sprint - FizzBuzz (Super Edition). All of a sudden there's a function staring at me & all I saw was jargon. Where do I start????
                    </p>
                  <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Initially tried writing out the pseudocode (that is, planning by writing out the steps in plain English), but what does THAT look like? Don't really have an idea on what the task is at hand. Alright, so it needs to loop through numbers & ask the questions:
                      <ol>
                        <li>Are you divisible by 3? Then do this ...</li>
                        <li>Are you divisible by 5? Then do this ...</li>
                        <li>Are you divisible by 3 & 5? Then do this ...</li>
                        <li>Else just do this ...</li>
                      </ol>
                      Noticed there was a possible solution hinted with this, but that's not in ENGLISH is it??!! What's the modulus symbol (%) have to do with anything? Thought that only calculated remainders?! Tried reading the code ... does this thing even work? Well look at that, yes, yes it does! Well no point in just copy/pasting, that defeats the purpose of me being here, I want to understand what I'm looking at.
                      <ul>
                        <li>Why did they calculate 'FizzBuzz' first?</li>
                        <li>Why divisible by '15'?</li>
                        <li>Why isn't 'fizzbuzz' declared?</li>
                        <li>What IS 'fizzbuzz'?</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Oh give me strength!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Looked at our Slack Community & yey, kindred spirits all in the same boat as me! Phew, I can breathe a sigh of relief, ok, ok. I've got this ... ah NOPE; I LIED!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Revisited Sprint 4's Workshop video & bombarded self with YouTube & Google; surely this stuff's sinking in, YES?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Why isn't it making sense??? Did I miss some critical exercises from the previous sprint? Man I need some serious help! Had loads of pit stops throughout the day thinking, I just need a break, gotta stop living & breathing this kata. Would come back & BOOM, hitting a brick wall - STILL??!
                    </p>
                  <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Roller coaster of emotions but mostly, useless! Others in our Slack Community were producing AMAZING CONTENT & had zoomed through the foundations training really easily & I kept self-doubting, wondering if this is really for me?! Can I build a Minesweeper game & a calculator soon? It's nice to see the direction we're heading into, but seriously? Will I be able to keep up? But, I'm really loving when things magically work the way they're supposed to. I've just got to keep believing that this <strong>IS</strong> where I truly need to be right now. I'm really enjoying utilising the extra braincell to make things work <strong>AND</strong> to understand what it is we're trying to achieve here.      
                    </p>
                  <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                    <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Procrastination gets you nowhere!</li>
                        <li>Take small bite-sized pieces regularly & chew over that</li>
                        <li>Don't beat self up over the unknown</li>
                        <li>Make sure you can interpret what it is you're coding & why you're completing this step before the next step</li>
                        <li>Don't overcomplicate things in your mind, the answers much easier than you think!</li> 
                        <li>3 multiplied by 5 = 15! Well duh, no comment!</li>
                        <li>Using the modulus symbol in an equation, finds out if there's a remainder & IF NOT, then the number MUST be divisible by the number 3 or 5 or both (in this scenario)!</li>
                        <li>If you calculate the answer to the hardest question first in the 'if' statements, it makes sense to filter throught the 'if else' statements after that</li>
                        <li>Do ask for help! It's much faster to know when you're heading in the right direction!</li>
                        <li>Do reiterate a process a few times to help stick in your mind</li>
                        <li>And finally, celebrate your success!</li>
                      </ul>

            <h3>Solving a Problem in an Elegant Way</h3>
                <p>
                  <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Was heading off on my son's school camp a few years back now, but it meant I would lose a whole week of study.
                    </p>
                  <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Wanted to do both & asked my tutor if I could base my multimedia project around my camping stint. He didn't think it would be ideal, but as long as I could tick off all of the learning outcomes to complete the project then, I was good to go!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was a lot of preparation work involved, as I needed to revise the expected outcome, figure out what technology I needed to take with me, to capture images, video, audio & also needed something to store my content on (e.g. laptop & external hard drive for backup purposes). Then, as the campsite didn't have internet access & limited power supply in places, how was I going to charge things & keep up with my homework? Took a 6-way multi-plug power supply & mini extension lead, expecting to find somewhere in the kitchen or dining room area that I could set up base close to a plug outlet. Also (before heading to camp), I managed to download content to my local drive & printed off other things just to make learning outside of my classroom setup a productive one still! Pretty much had to think of everything I would need, as I wouldn't be able to go back to Camp Kaitawa (near Lake Waikaremoana), once the school trip was over. 
                  </p>

                  <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Loved the entire week! Enjoyed being out in nature, hiking around & seeing different sights while also having the bonding session with my boy & his mates ... It was like a win-win situation ... until my batteries on my digital camera died on Day 1!!!!! Freaked out mode started settling in when my back-up rechargeables didn't last the distance & drained soon after too! My brick of a phone was too OLD to capture much without dying quickly & yet that was ALL I had to rely on; I was gutted! Would limit the amount of images I'd capture every day, so it lasted the distance. Would then come back to the campsite, download & charge things up for the following day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thankfully I had limped through the whole week ok & managed to capture enough content to produce an interactive multimedia site that I was happy to call my own work.
                    </p>
                  <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                    <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Preparation is key</li>
                        <li>DO NOT USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES for your digital cameras - they DON'T LAST LONG!</li>
                        <li>Take some time out of your busy schedule to spend some quality time with friends & loved ones</li>
                        <li>Be present in the moment</li>
                        <li>Enjoy loving what you do!</li>
                      </ul>

          <h2>Problem Solving Techniques & Processes</h2>
            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
              <p>
                This is just writing a description of the steps or process that will be completed before delving into the task at hand. It helps you to gather your thoughts by identifying what it is you need to do. But, when you're writing a comment in your code, it also helps others that come along after you, as it could help them interpret your code in case they need to update something in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                This doesn't help me if I initally have no idea on what we're actually needing to accomplish however, I did realise, I use this process often in daily life, as it helps me jot down things that need to be done, then come back & continue where I left off without much difficulty. It definitely makes me feel smarter if I can come back & remember what's next to execute off my list.
              </p>
            <h3>Trying something</h3>
              <p>
                This is definitely me! I like mucking around with things just to see how they work. Think I get that from my Pop who generally retrieved something broken from the dump, pulled things apart (but in a methodical manner), give them a clean, or sharpen, an oil or replace parts & most of the time he'd get the machine back up & running. Best way to discover how things tick! If I didn't know much about something, this process helps me learn more about it & I definitely feel like I'm accomplishing something by problem-solving this way.
              </p>
            <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
              <p>
                I also like this method. Basically the story behind this stems from a programmer (let's call him "Tom") who kept annoying another programmer ("Harry"). Tom would go & tell Harry about his issue, however by talking things through with another person, Tom had solved his own problem & didn't really need to annoy Harry, who suggested, that Tom have a rubber ducky on his desk. Everytime Tom gets stumped, he just needed to talk the process through with this rubber ducky & hopefully he'll gain the answer that way. Thought this was a cool idea & didn't really know that I'd like talking things through as well, but I rattled things off to my partner who understands a lot of this & he'd ask questions that would make me question my own logic & then after some deep reflection I realised, it made sense, so I must be on the right path! It did make me feel better by understanding what I was tackling at the time.
              </p>

            <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
              <p>
              Have a 'love/hate' relationship with error messages. Sometimes I like these messages that pop up helping to fix my problem & steer me in the direction towards a solution & then other times its like, 'What IS this jargon? That's not a solution! English people, can I have it in English pppplllleeeeaaaasssseeee?'
              </p>

            <h3>Console.logging</h3>
              <p>
                Just discovered recently & like so far. It's nice to know that you can write a process out & then use <strong>console.log()</strong> function at any stage to message the output through a debugging console. It identifies if your codes working correctly as & when needed. 
              </p>
              
            <h3>Googling</h3>
              <p>
                Generally, Google is my friend, however, not while in this realm. I don't seem to be asking the right questions as I'm led to community forums where it's peoples opinions & the content seems too advanced for my liking, so I give up & steer towards video content more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Otherwise, if it's every day questions I need answers on, I'm definitely Googling as I just love having an encyclopaedia at your fingertips!
              </p>

            <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
              <p>
                This has been a refreshing exercise, especially within the Slack Community. Everyone here at EDA are very approachable & willing to lend a hand! Just love that vibe!            
              </p>

            <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
              <p>
                Nice to be able to go over things that may need to be polished up on during my weekly 1 on 1's. It helps clarify & cement processes in my mind which I find quite helpful.
              </p>
            
            <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>    
              <p>
                This too is interesting. I'd reflect on things that'll trigger something I wanted to go back to. E.g. had to revisit my website as I wasn't happy with the layout & really wanted another format. Looking at the HTML & CSS code was starting to make sense now. It was a nice feeling knowing I could make a mess of things, but still fix it again. I could get lost beautifying my site to my standards, but I can do that at a later stage; this'll do for now!
