        <h2>Reflections over Foundations Sprints</h2>

          <h3>Empathetic, Self-Awareness Values</h3>
            <p>
              Life's journey, has given me the opportunity to be able to evaluate myself by soulfully checking in, asking: "Am I ok?"" If yes, then keep doing what you love, otherwise if not, what's stopping you from following your dreams & how can you get over this particular hurdle? Life's too short; enjoy it while you can!
            </p>
            <p>
              We are unique individuals that have to get along with loved ones as well as your peers or colleagues. So how can a shift in your attitude make things better?
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a social-butterfly, I enjoy being around other people. Upon reflection, I discovered I 'people-watch'! Just love watching how we interact with others. Humans are such fascinating creatures!  I can easily socialise with others, being present in a conversation & being mindful of other people's thoughts & feelings around me. Can't explain how & when this happened, but I've always been able to gauge a person's character from both their spoken language while also observing their body language (that can say something else) as well. Then there's other times where I just need some time out alone to gather my thoughts to re-center & have a chance to heal.
            </p>
            <p>
              This lead me to understand the difference between Growth vs Fixed Mindsets & EQ vs IQ. I definitely need to expand my mind, constantly searching to fill it with more knowledge; just love being a sponge! 'm more in tune with my Emotional Quotient (EQ) self but I toggle into my intellectual (IQ) self often too. Found it weird that EDA really focused on these areas, but understand where they're coming from & why they're wanting us to develop an understanding here. I did find the core learning challenging in the sense that I came into this training already having an understanding about this & I would have preferred us to have the option to opt out so that I could spend more time focusing on the programming aspects instead. But in saying that, found 'neuroplasticity' quite interesting in the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having an entreuprenual vibe, I already knew that I do things differently to the normal. My visions tend to be quite extreme where people can't see the end-goal until it's right there in front of them. I'm one of those people at the moment where I kow where I want to be but can't see how to get there. But I'm a go-getter, where I'll set myself a target to achieve & will somehow find a way to reach this goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since starting this course, I've had the fingers crossed that things will all make sense somehow. It's the drive that's kept me here having a sense of upskill yourself & utilise your smarts to do something you're passionate about.
            </p>
            <p>
              My ego is usually in check & never really explodes too large, unless I'm in a comfortable environment & my singing takes centre-stage. In relation to learning & programming, my ego needs to take a back-seat as I need to reach out more to either my facilitators, or our Slack Community as soon as I get stuck just to help me cross the line with a better understanding of things.  
            </p>
              <h2>Bootcamp Expectations</h2>
            </p>

          <h3>Long Term Goal & Career Path</h3>
            <p>
              Confidently being able to hold my ground as a well rounded programmer, being able to work together as a team & to also be able to take this skillset anywhere around the world & work hours that are suitably adjustable for my other interests in my realm.
            </p>
            
          <h3>Biggest Strengths & Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              Compared my thoughts from Sprint 2 to now; still the same. I have numerous interests that I would love to surround myself with daily. I seem to be able to multi-task a little better now that I have a few more weeks settled in however, silence is still my 'go-to' throughout the day & noticed my brick wall ego still exists. It's weird as I am literally scared of programming, yet it is something that I am drawn to still; how does that work?! Must be that 'Growth Mindset' going on!
            </p>
          <h3>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Not being physically together in the same location as my cohort
            </p>

          <h3>Non-Techncial Skills - Human Skills</h3>
            <p>
              Teaming up with the Peer Programming. Hoping this adjustment will be beneficial for myself as well as my peers 
            </p>

          <h3>Bootcamp Expectations</h3>
            <p>
              Wanting to be able to put my hand up in a timely manner in  order to be able to keep up with the rest of the cohort. I'm wanting to have the opportunity to learn & grow with confidence in programming
