    <h2> Question: Do you FEEL MORE (EQ) or THINK MORE (IQ)? | Does your intelligence come from your heart or your brain?</h2>

    <h3>Emotional Quotient (EQ) – intelligence from your heart</h3>
        <p>This is where people have the ability to feel & understand their own self-awareness, recognising how their behavioural patterns can have an impact on both their home & work-life surroundings. EQ’s can be taught to ‘read people’ & watch for behaviour patterns, but a lot that EQ’s possess, cannot be taught as it is an emotional feeling within oneself.</p>

    <h3>Intelligence Quotient (IQ) – intelligence from your head</h3>
        <p>You may have heard people asking the question, ”What’s your IQ?”, as some countries will measure this in a test format & give you an output figure that categorises your smarts within this spectrum. These people differ from EQ’s where IQ’s are generally deep-thinking scholars who will mull over facts or think ‘outside the box’ to come up with ideas no others have thought of. This cognitive intelligence gives them the ability to think & apply their knowledge while having less to do with success & happiness that EQ’s would possess.</p>
        
    <h3>Why is EQ so important?</h3>
        <p>EQ’s can have the ability to adjust their emotions based on sound reasoning. This is usually after they have been shown the ‘how & why’ before coming to their own conclusion.</p>

        <p>They make great leaders (especially if they are armed with a high IQ as well), as they manage people better knowing how to measure emotional intelligence that’s based on interpreting others’ moods & emotions as they are driven by more success & happiness.</p>
        
    <h3>Are you more of an IQ or EQ?</h3>
       <p>I generally am a mixture of both, where most of the time, I am an IQ & will churn things over in my head throughout the day, but then my EQ will override, when surrounded by people as I’m the one who can relate to others & will have people opening up & sharing parts of their lives that they may not have done to a random stranger. I generally invest an interest in the conversation & will follow-up on things we had discussed when our paths cross again. It makes people feel that they were heard & I’ve made a few life-long friends this way, over the years. </p>
