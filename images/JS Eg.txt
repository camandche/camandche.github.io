<p>Explanation: The do/while loop initially has <b>i</b> set to 0.
The loop will continue to run (do process) by increasing the 'i'
count by one each time the loop runs</p>
<p>It will continue this loop while i is less than or equal to 20 &
will document the outcome while this condition remains true.</p>
